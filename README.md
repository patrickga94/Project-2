# Dungeons and Dragons Spell App
**An all purpose spellbook for adventurers**

User Story: 
- As a user I want to open the app to a login/signup screen
- As a user I want to enter a username and password to login or create a new account
- As a user after logging in I want to see an index of my created characters and the ability to add or update characters
- As a user I want to create a character with a name, class, subclass, and level
- As a user I want to be able to view these characters individually and see their attributes as well as a spell list
- As a user I want to be able to select spells to add to my known spells list, remove spells from my known spells list, and mark spells as prepared or unprepared
- As a user I want to be able to create my own spells with forms for name, description, level, damage, requirements, and higher level effects

Technologies:

I plan on using CSS, javascript, mongoose, mongodb, express, liquid, and the dnd5eapi
